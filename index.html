		Welocme to Sugarizer!</h1>
  <p>Sugar labs welcome you to sugarizer.<br />
    This activity is will introduce you to Sugarizer. Sugar labs which is a non profit organisation. Sugar Labs contributes to and helps maintain the award-winning Sugar Learning Platform, which promotes collaborative learning through Sugar Activities.Sugar is a learning platform that reinvents how computers are used for education. Collaboration, reflection, and discovery are integrated directly into the user interface. Sugar promotes "studio thinking" and "reflective practice". Through Sugar's clarity of design, children and teachers have the opportunity to use computers on their own terms. Students can reshape, reinvent, and reapply both software and content into powerful learning activities. Sugar's focus on sharing, criticism, and exploration is grounded in the culture of free software (FLOSS).Sugarizer is a way to use Sugar on any device using web technologies (HTML5/JavaScript). Strictly speaking, Sugarizer is not a port of Sugar. Sugarizer is based on Sugar Web library, which mimics the Sugar UI using HTML5 and CSS3 and reproduces Sugar views (Home, List, ...). Sugarizer reimplements features of Sugar Core (datastore and journal) in JavaScript and integrates a bunch of activities written for Sugar in Sugar Web. So basically, Sugarizer is "just" a launcher of Sugar Web activities. A Sugarizer server component allows collaboration and presence.
Sugarizer could run any Sugar activities written in HTML5/JavaScript (Gears, Abecedarium, ...) and include a bunch of Sugar activities written initially in Python an ported in HTML5/JavaScript (Physics, Paint, ...).</p>
<h1>Sugar Labs</h1>
<p>The Sugar development platform is available under the open-source GNU General Public License (GPL) to anyone who wants to extend it. “Sugar Labs” is a member project of the Software Freedom Conservancy (a non-profit foundation to produce and distribute and support the use of free software) and serves as a support base and gathering place for the community of educators and software developers who want to extend the platform and who have been creating Sugar-compatible applications.Sugar Labs® is a volunteer-driven member project of Software Freedom Conservancy, a nonprofit corporation. Originally part of the One Laptop Per Child project, Sugar Labs coordinates volunteers around the world who are passionate about providing educational opportunities to children through the Sugar Learning Platform. Sugar Labs® is supported by donations and is seeking funding to accelerate development.In order for Sugar to be successful, it needs the participation of a large number of people who share common goals while maintaining independence, so that each participant has the ability to act independently. For these reasons, Sugar Labs subscribes to the principles described here, which are the author's own translation of an original text in Spanish.A local Sugar Lab adapts the technology and pedagogy to an area's culture and resources (e.g., developing activities and content specific to a region); helps translate Sugar to the local language(s); supports Sugar deployments in area schools; creates a local community devoted to the Sugar Labs principles, making Sugar more open and sustainable; provides for communication, between the local communities and the global Sugar Labs community; develops Local content and software that can be used not only for local purposes but also for the overall community; hosts, co-hosts or partners in the organization of conferences, workshops, talks and meetings related to the use or development of Sugar.
